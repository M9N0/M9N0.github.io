        <p>Dear Maliha,</p>
        <p>I don't know how to start. I've never met you in person, but even though we met online, you've been my inspiration for life. First of all, I want to thank you because since you came into my life, I've been able to feel love anew</p>
        <p>Even though we've only known each other for a short time, you're now the most precious person in my life. Meeting you, holding your hand, and spending the rest of my life with you is like a beautiful dream in my life </p>
        <p>I hope your future life will be beautiful, happy and all the sorrows and pains in your past will be erased. May you be successful, I am always by your side. You said it is very difficult to trust people, I will say forget everything from the past and give a chance to the one who loves you so much </p>
        <p class="signature">Your Fevorite,<br>Mynouddin </p>
